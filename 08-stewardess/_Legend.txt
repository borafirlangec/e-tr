8. Stewardess
 
In the 8th step we have stewardess for translating and recording with human voice. Eurofly supports more voices, so you can also make more series of stewardess.
  As an example use the stewardess from original english version. For using a new steward, you only need to create a new folder (the name of folder must contain a language prefix and name of the dispatcher). To this folder put the files with phrases like in english stewardess. 
  In sounds folder you find the audio effects of preparing coffee or coming of steward. you can mix it to your recordings. If you can't make the editting and effect/mixing part, please record all at once in one track and send us. We'll do these parts for you.

A: First off speak Stewardes - phrases.txt
B: Then go to 1 - Sounds subfolder/_Legend.txt
C: and then 2 - Script/_Legend.txt.

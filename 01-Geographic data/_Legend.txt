1. Geographics data
go to
Eurofly\data\Geonames
and
Eurofly\data\Openstreetmap

 
In data folder we have some files with geographics data. Open the file, read the name of object on the line and replace it with the name in your language.
 
A: Geonames subfolder, open just the .def files - 4 files:
Continents.def - continents and seas in translated language (delete original string replacing it with translated string)

Groups.def - abbreviations for some states (delete original string replacing it with translated string)

Islands.def - islands in translated language (delete original string replacing it with translated string)

States.def - states in translated languages (delete original string replacing it with translated string)

B: Openstreetmap subfolder, the same translating mechanism just like Geonames before - 4 files.

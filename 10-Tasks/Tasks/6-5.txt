 %XY, today you will fly a large Boeing 777 to a scheduled flight Palau Russia with two stopovers. You start your flight in Russia, Vladivostok and just point It to Tokyo, where you will make the first stopover. From Tokyo then you will fly to Taiwan, where you land at the airport in Taipei. Finally, of course from Palau handle to Taiwan and land at the destination in Melekeok. It will be difficult, but you can do it. Good luck.

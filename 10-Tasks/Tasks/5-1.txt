 %XY, today's task is extremely important. You are to fly the Russian president on an official visit to China. Your route is from Moscow streight to Beijing. It's a long flight and obviously you'll need somewhere to land and refuel and/or change aircraft if you wish. This shouldn't be too difficult for you as you are an experienced pilot. Since you are carrying top Russian officials, you have no restrictions to flight. Take care of your safety and the prominent passengers. Good luck and God speed.

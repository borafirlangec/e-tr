Welcome to Eurofly, %XY! In just a few flights, you'll be clocking hours in our employ. We'll give you ten flights to test your pilot skills. Your first test: Take this Cessna 172 and depart from Nove Zamky and set course to Surany. It's a very short flight, so if there's any problems, we're hoping they're technical. Good luck!

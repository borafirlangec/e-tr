 %XY, today you will take French scientists, whose go to the Egypt to do archaeological research. Your flight will begin in Paris and the first stopover will be in Marseille, where will board other scientists. Then you take a course to Egypt. But does worry us southern Italy, where some volcanoes awaken and make it impossible to fly over the Italian territory, therefore you must avoid It. In Egypt you land first at Alexandria and then even more will fly to Cairo, where your flight is completed. Good luck.

 %XY, congratulation. You've ben promoted. You now have the privilege of flying over the sea. isn't that wonderful? Anyway on with your briefing. you will take some folks who are on vacation from Prague and Bratislava to Greek island Rho dos. Start in Prague, stop in Bratislava and finally land in Rho dos, Be aware you still need to avoid Austria, You are still prohibited from flying into said airspace. Good luck.

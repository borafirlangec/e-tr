 %XY, That Svalbard flight was fun eh?  I have now for you a simple journey for  you today. As you know, the Protestants in 2017 celebrate 500 years since the Reformation. The Pope has agreed to come to this celebration, so please take him from Roma to the German city of Augsburg, where the celebration will be held. may god bless you and keep you.

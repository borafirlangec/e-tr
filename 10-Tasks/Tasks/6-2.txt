 %XY, you have done it perfectly and now one more flight like It. Here on the scattered islands is experienced pilot very handy. Take off at the airport in Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea, fly first to the Solomon Islands where you land, and finally head to Vanuatu where your flight is ending at the airport in Port Vila. Good luck.

 %XY, you will fly again on a regular link Chad - Congo, in this case with two stops in Central Africa and Cameroon. The route is therefore as follows: you take off at the airport of N'Djamena in Chad, from there you will fly first to Bangui in Central Africa. There you take more passengers and go to Yaoundé in Cameroon. Then you pick up a course and lands in Congo Brazzaville. Good luck.

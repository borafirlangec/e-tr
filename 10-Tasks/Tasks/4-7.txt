 %XY, when you're already at home, we entrust you with the flight that will take you back to Africa. In South Sudan because the rebels killed Slovak missionary, you will get a Slovak delegation to the funeral. This is not a regular flight. You will fly Embraer Legacy 600 on the Bratislava Juba. Your air travel must be through Greece and Egypt, on the contrary, you must avoid Lybia. Good luck.

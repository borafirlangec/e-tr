 %XY, A travel agency has once again hired us to get people on holiday from Bratislava to the Greek island of Zakinthos. Start in Bratislava, next land in Brno-Tu?any, next go to Prague-Ruzyne and finally land at Greece. On the way to Brno do not fly into Austrian airspace. enjoy the sunshine. I'm just a tad jealous right now.

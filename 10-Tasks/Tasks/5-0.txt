%XY, once again you have been promoted, though we really need to change up this training program *cough*. You are now authorized to fly in Europe, Affrica and Asia. We now entrust you with a beautiful flight. Please take these Catholic *ahem* Slovak Churchman to God's Holy land. Depart from Bratislava and take two legs, the first one to Tel Aviv, the second to your final destination, Eilat in Israel. Beautiful skies to you and your... our, crew.

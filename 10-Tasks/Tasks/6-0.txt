 %XY, congratulations on your hard work. you have been promoted! We are happy for you. Your rank now is officially first pilot. You have now earned the distinct privilege of flying large aircraft. These are category 3, and truly overcome long distances. You have already been scheduled for a long flight from The Philippines to Australia with a stopover in Indonesia. Take a large Boeing 777, depart from Manila, make a stop in Jakarta and finally land at the airport in Canberra, Australia. Have a good time.

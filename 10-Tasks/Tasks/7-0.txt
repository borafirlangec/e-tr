 %XY, again, congratulations on promotion. You became captain, your options are no longer limited. I believe you will celebrate your progress by a pleasant trip to New York. As captain take over a scheduled flight Bratislava Prague-Ruzyne Airport, London and New York. On the way to Prague, keep in mind that your flight path leads outside Austria. Hold on and enjoy it.

 %XY, a group of Slovak sportsmen decided to go to the Alps for training. They hired our company, so It will your work. You will take off in Poprad with first batch of passengers. You will land in Bratislava, where you take next passengers and you will continue to the Austrian city Salzburg. It is your first flight with stopover. You will have many flights with stopovers in future, so keep in mind that you must unboard and next board new passengers on every stopover. I am sure, that you will manage It.

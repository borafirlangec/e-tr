 %XY, today you are deployed on challenging line flight from Peru to Colorado's. Along the way you also have three stops, so it will be hard work. Take off at the airport in Denver, Colorado and head to Utah, where you land at the airport in Salt Lake City. From there fly to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and finally even land on the airport in Panama. After three stops regain course and land in Peru Lima. Along the way  is prohibited to enter the airspace of Ecuador. Take care.

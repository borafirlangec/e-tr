 %XY, after your already completed flights, you have unique chance to fly to the Paris. One czech travel agency which is organising excursions to the Paris hired us. You will start in Ostrava, take on new passengers in Brno-Tuřany, and you will continue to the Prague-Ruzině, where you will also take on passengers. After It, you will take off and set course to the Paris. Good luck and enjoy It.

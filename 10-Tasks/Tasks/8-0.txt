 %XY, congratulations, again any promotion and you became captain with the permission to teach. This is a really high level and we have full confidence in you. That is why you are now on a challenging flight from Costa Rica to Puerto Rico. It is a volatile area and the biggest problem for us is Venezuela, therefore, avoid it. You drive passengers from the airport in San José in Costa Rica, land at the airport in Bogota, Colombia, and finally end the flight at the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. As I said, avoid the territory of Venezuela. Good luck.

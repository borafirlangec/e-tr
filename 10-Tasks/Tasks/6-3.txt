 %XY, you are thirdly deployed on regular flight over the islands. Today - when you're already in Port Vila, start right now and fly to Fiji and Tonga. So you pick up after take-off course of Suva where you land and then continue to the airport Nuku'alofav Tonga where your service will be completed. Good luck.

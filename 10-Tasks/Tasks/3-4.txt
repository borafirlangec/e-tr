 %XY, today's flight will be a little easier and yet extremely challenging. You have a distinguished guest who is a little bit of a nitpick in regard to what he wants to see. Take the Airspeed Ambassador AS.57 2; You have on board said guest who happens to be the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Your task is to fly him from Berlin to negotiate some treaties at Athens. Your task is easy as you have no layovers this time; The challenge comes in as you need to bypass Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro and Macedonia. This chancellor doesn't care to see the mass of refugees who are gathered in those countries. May your flight go safely.

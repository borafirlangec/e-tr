 %XY, You are aware work in Slovakia and the Czech Republic is few and far between, so we have contracted workers from our country to help out where help is needed. Your task? Fly from Ostrava to London and pick up those who have volunteered to help out. Your layover are: Brno-Tu?any and Prague-Ruzyne. finally land at the British Isles. Good luck.

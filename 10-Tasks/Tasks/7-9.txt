 %XY, after scheduled flights we have again chartered flight for you. Drive holidaymakers from Minnesota and Missouri to Costa Rica, to land in Honduras. Thus, you take off at the airport in St. Paul land in Jefferson City, then in Tegucigalpa and finally pick up a course in Costa Rica and land at the airport in San Jose. Have a good time.

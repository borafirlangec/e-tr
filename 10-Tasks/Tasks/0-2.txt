%XY, let's step it up with a bit bigger aircraft. This is the Embraer Legacy 600. It's one of our business jets in our fleet. Even though it can take more people, you will not take any passengers as before. You'll depart from Boleráz and head to Holic this time, a longer flight that should get you comfortable with handling multiple designated controlled airspaces. As always, good luck!

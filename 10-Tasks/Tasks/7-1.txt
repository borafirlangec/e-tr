 %XY, as an experienced pilot with the rank of captain now you have the freedom to fly over the United States, which in your case we will use and deploy you to the scheduled flight New York Los Angeles with stops in Washington, Mississippi and Texas. Thus, fly in New York, make the first stop in the capital of the United States, the other at the airport in Jackson Mississippi, next at the airport in Austin, Texas, and finally land in Los Angeles. Nice flight.

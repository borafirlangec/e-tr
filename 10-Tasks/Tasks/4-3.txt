 %XY, when you're in the Algiers, we put you on a scheduled flight Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania. Yes, also there our company fly. You will fly the aircraft McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31 from the airport in Algiers, land at the airport in the capital of Morocco, Rabat, and finally go to the city of Nouakchott, which is the capital of Mauritania. Here, however is the Western Sahara. Flew through it would be the easiest way indeed, but for various reasons this is not possible, so you have to work around the Western Sahara. I'm sure you'll manage. Good luck.

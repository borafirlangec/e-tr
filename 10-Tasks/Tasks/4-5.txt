 %XY, you will fly again on a regular link, now Mali - Gabon with stopovers on the island of São Tomé. Therefore start at the airport of Bamako in Mali, a stopover on the island of São Tomé and finally landing at the airport of Libreville, Gabon. On this journey is prohibited entry into the airspace of the State Burkina, therefore to be careful. Good luck.

Congratulation %XY, you have been promoted. You are now competent to make internaťional flights. Your first international flight will run from Bratislava to Prague, where you will land on international airport Prague-Ruzyně. You will fly by plane Boeing 707. Hovever, be carefull! Bratislava is located near Austrian border and you are not allowed to enter Austrian airspace. So, you will not go as the crow flies, but you must to set course after take off to avoid Austria. Good luck.

After this sentences please record all numbers of runways 1 2 3 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 with a little pause because we need to split the recording and have each number in separate file. The sentences rolltoway1 and rolltoway2 will be played together with numbers of runway so it is optimal record the sentences without decreasing the voice and numbers with the decreasing.

Note3: If you've already recorded a dispatcher you don't need to record again all numbers of runways 1 2 3 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 b1 b2 b3 b4 b5. Simply take them from your voice in Eurofly\audio\airport\tower.

It's necessary to record runway numbers if you record ground only as we need your voice saying these runway numbers. So don't forget to speak runway numbers too.

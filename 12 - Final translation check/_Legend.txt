12 - Final translation check
Note: jump to next chapter with asterisk * symbol:

Well, we're almost done with the complete Eurofly translation. Just tomake sure all is done perfectly and flawlessly let's check the translated files and also the structure of folders and subfolders. So here we go. You'll find the complete structure of files of how they're supposed to be placed. So compare them with your structure of folders and subfolders and file names. We recommend to do a few flights with the new Eurofly translation for a few days in case you stumble upon some glitches or untranslated string to be fixed or translated differently.

 Note: Bonus track: If you want you can try retrieving instruction safety video e.g. on Youtube in your language on what stewardes say before the flight about seat belts, oxigen masks etc. or you can speak it yourself in your language by what's spoken in English file.


OK, if you've gone through all the structure finding out all is perfect and if you've also flown with the new Eurofly translation finding out all is perfect too you've completed your translating mission successfully. We again gladly appreciate your hard work you put into Eurofly and huge thanks for the great job of yours and guys on board you've stayed in touch with working on dispatchers/towers, stewardes and grounds.
